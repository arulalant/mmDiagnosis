Multi Model Diagnosis - A Python Based Framework for Systematic Weather Model Diagnosis


Objective :
===========
This project aimed to give the solutions to access and implement scientific diagnostics over a generalized multi model 
dataset with its multi dimensional (time, forecast_time, level, latitude, longitude) and generate the result as image 
plots from single place. This will be used by the meteorologists / climatologists around the world. 
Non meteorologists also can use some of the modules where time axis comes in their dataset. 
Giving controls to the end users to play with multi models and produce diagnostics and their plots/figures using GUI & CUI.
