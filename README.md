Multi Model Diagnosis - A Python Based Framework for Systematic Weather Model Diagnosis


Objective :
===========
    This project aimed to give the solutions to access and implement scientific diagnostics over
    a generalized multi model dataset with its multi dimensional  
    (time, forecast_time, level, latitude, longitude) and generate the result as image plots
    from single place. This will be used by the meteorologists / climatologists around the world. 
    Non meteorologists also can use some of the modules where time axis comes in their dataset. 
    Giving controls to the end users to play with multi models and produce diagnostics and their
    plots/figures using GUI & CUI.

Note :
======

    In this repository we pushed / published only the limited modules. We didn't release the full 
    fledged features / code in public because still we are in developing more diagnostics. 
    We are working on this project since December 2010.
    Right now we have local repository which is accessibly inside IIT Delhi only. 
    By the next year end (2014), this project will be developed completely and launched fully in NCMRWF.
    By that time, we will release the full project under this same public repository.
