             modelHour is the model hours as list, which will become part of
             the directory structure.
             modelPath is the absolute path of data where the model xml files
             are located.
             modelXmlObj is an instance of the GribXmlAccess class instance.
             If we are passing modelXmlObj means, it will be optimized one
             when we calls this same function for same model for different
             months.

             We can pass either modelXmlPath or modelXmlObj KWarg is enough.

    Process : This function should compute the seasonly mean for analysis and
              fcstsyserr by just opening the monthly mena analysis/fcstsyserr
              nc files (according to the season's months) and multiply the
              monthly mean into its weights value. So that monthly mean data
              should become monthly full data (not mean). Then add it together
              for the season of months. Finally takes the average by just
              divide the whole season data by sum of monthly mean weights.
                So it should simplify our life, just extracting data which
              timeAxis length is 4, for 4 months in season. (eg JJAS).

    Outputs : It should create seasonly mean analysis and forecast systematic
              error for all the available variables in the vars.txt file,
              and store it as nc file in the proper directory structure
              (modelname, process name, year, season, and/or hours hierarchy).
